When working with higher-level languages like Python, you rarely think about how data structures are stored in memory. However, in Rust, memory placement plays a crucial role, directly impacting performance and code behavior. Let's explore how arrays (array) and vectors (Vec) work, along with their key similarities and differences.

1. Key Similarities and Differences and Memory Management.

Array (Array)

An array is a fixed-size container allocated on the stack. Its size is known at compile time, making it highly efficient to work with.
Example of an array in Rust:

let a: [i32; 5] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

Similarities with Vec:

‚úÖ Both store elements of the same type.

‚úÖ Both support iteration using for.

Differences:

‚ùå Fixed size: An array cannot be resized after creation.

‚ö° Stack allocation: Access to elements is extremely fast.

In Rust, arrays are placed on the stack by default since their size is known at compile time. However, if an array is too large, it can be allocated on the heap using wrappers like Box<[T; N]>. Without such wrappers, arrays remain on the stack.
Example of heap allocation for a large array:

fn large_array() -> Box<[i32; 1_000_000]> 

{
    Box::new([0; 1_000_000]) // This array will be allocated on the heap
}


Vector (Vec)

A vector (Vec) is a dynamic data structure stored in the heap, allowing it to grow and shrink at runtime.
Example of a vector in Rust:

let vec1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Similarities with Array:

‚úÖ Supports indexed access (vec[0]).

‚úÖ Can be passed to functions that work with sequences.

Differences:

‚úÖ Dynamic size: Elements can be added or removed.

üîÑ Heap allocation: Requires memory management.


By understanding these differences, we can optimize Rust programs for better performance and memory efficiency! üöÄ
